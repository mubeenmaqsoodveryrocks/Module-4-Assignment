Module 4 Assignment For Mubeen Maqsood

For this Assignment I Developed a Weather Data Analyzer Application. I used the enhanced switch statement, text blocks, lambdas, markdown support in Javadoc, and other new features. I also Parsed weather data from a CSV file.
My code included Average temperature for a specific month, Days with temperatures above a given threshold, and Count of rainy days.
I Included lambdas and streams to process weather data efficiently. My code has records, interfaces, and functional constructs.
